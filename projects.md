Here are some of the projects I have undertaken/worked on over the course of my undergraduate degree.

### 1. Remote Intelligent Assistant (REIA)	[link](https://github.com/aseem96/Remote-Intelligent-Assistant-REIA)

A desktop assistant for Linux based systems that enable the user to communicate with his/her machine in English/Natural Language , which is translated to the corresponding Linux command by our system. The project is based on Machine Learning and Natural Language processing and was undertaken as our final year project.

### 2. Traffic Analysis Application using Social Media feed

A machine learning model to analyze and predict traffic conditions in Pune based on feeds from social media like tweets, RSS feeds, FB status updates. The application extracts info such as location, reason for traffic congestion and displays the data on an interactive dashboard.

### 4. Shuttlecock Tracking and Trajectory Estimation using Microsoft Kinect

The project was undertaken in line with the theme for ​ ABU Robocon 2015 ​ theme ‘Robominton’, which was essentially a doubles badminton game between the robots of the contesting teams. The trajectory equation was transferred to the robot via Bluetooth. Regression algorithms were used for trajectory estimation. Project was completed under the valuable guidance of ​Castalia Research Labs, Pune​. Published our work in an international journal [link](http://www.ijaiem.org/Volume4Issue10/IJAIEM-2015-10-31-45.pdf).

### 5. Clean Energy Recharging the World - Theme for ABU Robocon 2014

The project was undertaken by our team as a part of ABU Robocon 2016 which is an international level Robotics contest held every year. The theme for this year was 'Clean Energy Recharging the World'. The object to develop two robots, one manual/autonomous and the other autonomous to accomplish certain tasks under a time limit, which included navigating a series of obstacles, with the larger bot(manual/autonomous) driving the smaller bot using a source of clean energy such as wind/magnetism etc, in a way that there is no contact or communication between the two.

### 6. A Salute to Parenthood - Theme for ABU Robocon 2014

The project was undertaken by our team as a part of ABU Robocon 2014 which is an international level Robotics contest held every year. The theme for this year was 'A Salute to Parenthood'. We had to develop two robots, one manual and the other autonomous to accomplish certain tasks under a time limit. Our team stood 4th all over India in the final event.

### 8. Restaurant Billing application using Core Java and applets

Designed and implemented an ordering and billing software for a chain of restaurants using OOP tools such as interfaces, classes etc. Functionality included seating, menu selection, ordering and billing. OOP concepts such as inheritance, abstraction and polymorphism were showcased, along with software design concepts like Use Case modelling, activity diagram, state diagram.

### 9. ​ Development of a dynamic website – Startup Hunter

​A basic website created using templates (HTML, CSS, and PHP) with database linking. The website gives the user functionality to register his/her business venture, so as to increase the online presence. The user can access the website and search for his/her requirement. As per the field of request, the relevant startup details are forwarded to the user. The project uses a SQL database in the backend.
