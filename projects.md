Here are some of the projects I have undertaken/worked on over the course of my undergraduate degree.

### 1. Remote Intelligent Assistant (REIA)	[link](https://github.com/aseem96/Remote-Intelligent-Assistant-REIA)

A desktop assistant for Linux based systems that enable the user to communicate with his/her machine in English/Natural Language , which is translated to the corresponding Linux command by our system. The project is based on Machine Learning and Natural Language processing and was undertaken as our final year project.

### 4. Shuttlecock Tracking and Trajectory Estimation using Microsoft Kinect

The objective of this project was to detect a shuttlecock in the initial phase of its flight and estimate the trajectory using regression concepts, using Microsoft Kinect. The above data was transferred to a robot for successful return of service. Published our work in an international journal [link](http://www.ijaiem.org/Volume4Issue10/IJAIEM-2015-10-31-45.pdf). The project was undertaken as a part of the theme of ABU Robocon 2015.
